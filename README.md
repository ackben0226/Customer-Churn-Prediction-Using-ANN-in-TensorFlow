## 📌 Key Highlights
- **Real-World Business Problem:** Tackles the critical issue of customer churn prediction in the telecom sector.
- __Machine Learning Expertise:__ Implements a neural network-based solution using TensorFlow, showcasing proficiency in cutting-edge AI tools.
- __Data-Driven Insights:__ Utilizes exploratory analysis to extract actionable trends.
- __Full Workflow Execution:__ Covers data preparation, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.


## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools
- Programming Language: Python <br/>
- Libraries:
  - TensorFlow – Neural network construction and training.
  - pandas, numpy – Data manipulation and analysis.
  - matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization.


###  Dataset: [Telecom Customer Churn Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YBIFoundation/Dataset/main/TelecomCustomerChurn.csv) <br/>
- __Skills Demonstrated:__ Data preprocessing, feature engineering, deep learning, and model evaluation.

## 🌐 Project Workflow
1. __Data Preprocessing:__
   -- Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
   - Scaling numerical features like tenure and MonthlyCharges for consistency.
2. __Exploratory Analysis:__
   - Visualizing relationships between churn and key variables (e.g., tenure, monthly charges).
3. __Modelling:__
   - Designing a multi-layer Artificial Neural Network using TensorFlow.
   - Incorporating dropout layers and activation functions to improve generalization.
4. __Evaluation:__
   - Assessing performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
     
## 📊 Sample Visualizations
### Tenure Distribution for Churned and Non-Churned Customers
_(Show a histogram of tenure distribution, visually comparing churned and non-churned groups.)_

### Monthly Charges Distribution
_(Highlight the relationship between monthly charges and customer churn.)_
(Include links or embedded images of plots here.)

## 🔥 Why This Project Stands Out
### Proactive Problem Solving: Identifies at-risk customers, enabling tailored retention strategies.
- __Scalable Design:__ The model is flexible and can be adapted to other industries or datasets.
- __Professional Workflow:__ Showcases a deep understanding of data engineering and machine learning.
